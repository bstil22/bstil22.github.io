My name is Brady. I am a junior rails developer based in San Francisco, who enjoys
writing solid code. If you'd like to check out what I'm working on, my github page
can be found <a href="https://github.com/bstil22">here</a>. If you'd
like to collaborate on a project or provide feedback on a particular blog post, feel free to send
me an <a href="mailto:bstil22@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20" target="_top">email</a>.
